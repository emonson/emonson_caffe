## emonson_caffe

An attempt to make some of the [Caffe][caffe] examples easier to run.
See the individual directories for detailed instructions.
(Currently the only example is [lenet_images](https://github.com/emonson/emonson_caffe/tree/master/lenet_images).)

This is a collaboration with [Mauro Maggioni][mauro] and [Rachel Yin][rachel] at [Duke University][duke].
